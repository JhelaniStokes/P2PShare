This project is a work in progress and not yet in a usable state.
Itâ€™s being built as a learning project to explore peer-to-peer networking, QUIC, and distributed file sharing.
Expect incomplete features, frequent changes, and lots of experimentation.
Once a basic MVP is complete, the README and documentation will be updated.
